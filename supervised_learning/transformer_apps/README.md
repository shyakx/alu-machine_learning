## Overview

Transformers are attention-based models introduced in the paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). They have become the backbone of state-of-the-art models in NLP, vision, and multi-modal tasks.

## Applications

This repository includes implementations and examples for:

- **Text Classification**
- **Machine Translation**
- **Text Summarization**
- **Image Classification (Vision Transformers)**
- **Question Answering**
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Tasks**

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformer_apps.git
cd transformer_apps
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each application is organized in its own directory with instructions. Example for text classification:

```bash
cd text_classification
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

Refer to the README in each subdirectory for detailed usage.
