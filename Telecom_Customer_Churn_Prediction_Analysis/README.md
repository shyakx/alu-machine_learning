# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, model training (Logistic Regression and Random Forest), evaluation, and deployment. The pipeline is scalable and includes a web application for predictions, retraining, and monitoring.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical features.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Compares Logistic Regression and Random Forest, selects the best model based on F1-score.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifies key factors affecting churn.
- **Web Application**: Allows users to upload data and make predictions.
- **Retraining Mechanism**: Supports model retraining with new data.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Containerized with Docker for scalability.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Customer_Churn_ML.git
   cd Customer_Churn_ML
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run Jupyter Notebook for analysis:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook notebook/customer_churn_analysis.ipynb
   ```
4. Start the web application:
   ```sh
   python app/app.py
   ```
5. To retrain the model, upload new data via the web app and trigger retraining.

## Deployment
- Use Docker to containerize the application:
  ```sh
  docker build -t churn-prediction-app .
  docker run -p 5000:5000 churn-prediction-app
  ```
- Deploy on a cloud platform (AWS/GCP/Azure) as described in `deployment/cloud_setup.md`.

## Usage
- Upload customer data in CSV format.
- Get churn predictions instantly.
- View feature importance insights.
- Retrain the model with new data.
