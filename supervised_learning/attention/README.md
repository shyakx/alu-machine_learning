# Attention in Deep Learning

Attention mechanisms have become a fundamental component in modern deep learning architectures, especially in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks. They enable models to focus on relevant parts of the input data, improving performance and interpretability.

## What is Attention?

Attention allows a model to dynamically weigh the importance of different input elements when making predictions. Instead of processing all information equally, the model learns to "attend" to the most relevant parts.

## Types of Attention

- **Soft Attention:** Assigns continuous weights to all input elements.
- **Hard Attention:** Selects specific elements, often using sampling (non-differentiable).
- **Self-Attention:** Computes attention within a single sequence (used in Transformers).
- **Global vs. Local Attention:** Global considers all positions; local restricts to a window.

## Applications

- **Machine Translation:** Improves alignment between source and target sentences.
- **Text Summarization:** Focuses on key sentences or phrases.
- **Image Captioning:** Attends to relevant image regions.
- **Transformers:** Foundation of models like BERT and GPT.
