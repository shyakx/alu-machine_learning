# 📡 Telecom Churn Prediction - AI Model & Deployment 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using a deep learning model. The trained model is deployed as an API, allowing businesses to integrate it into their systems for real-time predictions.

## 🎯 Features

✅ Machine learning-based churn prediction 📊\
✅ REST API for easy integration 🛠️\
✅ Scalable deployment using Docker & FastAPI ⚡\
✅ Interactive Swagger UI for API testing 🔥\
✅ Frontend for visualization 🌐

## API Endpoints

- Prediction Endpoint: [API_URL]/predict

- Retraining Endpoint: [API_URL]/retrain

- Swagger Documentation: [SWAGGER_UI_URL]

## Prediction Process

The prediction process enables users to obtain churn predictions based on input data. The steps involved are:

- User Input: The user submits customer data via the API or frontend.

- Preprocessing: The input data is standardized using the saved scaler.pkl file to match the trained model’s format.

- Model Inference: The request is passed to the deployed model, which makes a prediction.

- Thresholding: The model outputs a probability score, which is converted into a binary classification (churn or not) using a threshold (e.g., 0.5).

- Response: The API returns the prediction result, indicating whether the customer is likely to churn, along with confidence scores.

## Retraining Process

Users can upload new data to retrain the model automatically. The retraining process:

- Reads new data uploaded by users.

- Preprocesses and integrates the new data into the training set.

- Triggers the training script to update the model.

- Saves the new best-performing model and updates the deployment.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1️⃣ API Usage

Send a POST request to the API with customer data:

```bash
curl -X POST "YOUR_API_URL/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "account_length": 120,
    "international_plan": 1,
    "voice_mail_plan": 0,
    "total_day_minutes": 300,
    "total_eve_minutes": 250,
    "total_night_minutes": 200,
    "total_intl_minutes": 15,
    "customer_service_calls": 3
}'
```

Response Example:

```json
{
    "churn_probability": 0.85,
    "prediction": "Churn Likely"
}
```

### 2️⃣ Run Locally (Development Mode)

#### Backend Setup:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

#### Frontend Setup:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
